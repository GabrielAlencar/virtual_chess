# Gabriel's Virtual Chess Game

This project was inspired on one of the repositories developed by PhD. NÃ©lio Muniz Mendes Alves (you can check it on https://github.com/acenelio/chess-system-java). It is important to state that the application must be executed in a GIT terminal to guarantee the correct printing of the board and its pieces.

Here is some useful information:

* The players can perform all of the special moves (castling, en passant and promotion);
* A player can type the source position where the target position is required, in order to reset the selection and check another piece;
* The match automatically stops when a Checkmate or a Stalemate is detected;
* If the game needs to be stopped even without being finished, press Ctrl+C.

OBS.: Stalemate is a condition where the player is not in check and has no legal move. It is considered as a draw.

After reading this file, you are ready to download and run the application on your computer. Have fun!
